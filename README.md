### In this project, I analyze whether there are more positive or negative views of ChatGPT in the media. Using the Reddit API, The New York Times API, and NewsAPI, I extract articles related to ChatGPT and apply Data Science techniques in order clean and visualize the data. Lastly, I use tool called Vader Sentiment Analysis in order to reach a census of what the overall sentiment is from analyzing the data.
